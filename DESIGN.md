# Design Document for FocusFlow Study and Productivity Website

Purpose

This project is a full-featured productivity dashboard combining several tools into one integrated interface:

  Task management
  -  Goal tracking
  -  Journaling
  -  Study session tracking
  -  Daily event scheduling
  -  The system is built for clarity, low friction, and fast local performance.
  -  The architecture follows a lightweight MVC style:
  -  Models: SQLite tables
  -  Views: Jinja2 templates
  -  Controllers: Flask routes
  -  Application Components
  -  Layout Template
  -  All pages extend layout.html 

layout
  Global navigation bar
  Unified styling
  Page content insertion via {% block content %}
  Page-specific scripts loaded via {% block scripts %}
  This creates a consistent UI shell and dramatically reduces duplicated code.

Individual Page Templates
  Dashboard / Calendar View
  index.html handles the monthly calendar and the study timer system.
  Features include:
  Previous/next month navigation
  Study session timer banner
  Reflection modal for saving study session notes

Day View (Hourly Schedule) days.html builds the interactive 24-hour daily event schedule.
It includes:
  A dynamic grid generated by JS
  A modal for creating/editing events
  Category → color mapping
  The UI is intentionally minimal so that JavaScript can dynamically populate events for the selected date.

Goals View

goals.html contains:
  A collapsible “Add Goal” form
  A list of all stored goals
  An edit modal with pre-filled fields
  The template uses Jinja loops to display goals and cleanly separates CRUD logic (Flask) from UI rendering.

Tasks View
  tasks.html uses the same structural pattern as goals:
  Hidden task creation form
  Task list with edit/delete controls
  Pop-up modal for editing task data
  The consistency between tasks and goals improves UX and code maintainability.

Frontend Design & Interaction
  Core UX Principles
  Minimal UI surfaces
  Modals for focused actions
  Semantic markup (e.g., lists, labels, buttons)
  Mobile-friendly (responsive container classes)
  Hidden/visible toggling via simple CSS classes

JavaScript Responsibilities

Each template loads only the JS it needs, which prevents script collisions and keeps the site modular.

Examples:
  days.js for the daily schedule
  tasks.js for task editing
  goals.js for goal editing
  calendar.js for monthly navigation + study sessions
  This pattern supports a scalable codebase.

Modal Windows
  Modals appear in 4 major areas:
  Editing tasks (tasks.html)
  Editing goals (goals.html)
  Adding/editing events (days.html)
  Entering study reflection notes (index.html)
  All modals follow a consistent structure:
  Overlay → darkens background
  Content box → form inputs
  Buttons → Save/Cancel
  This creates a uniform interaction model across the entire app.

Database Design

The database initializes automatically from app.py and includes:

Table	Purpose
tasks	Individual actionable items
goals	Longer-term objectives
journals	Daily written reflections
study_sessions	Timed study logs
events	Scheduled blocks on a chosen day

Each feature corresponds directly to a template and JavaScript file.

Feature Workflows

Tasks & Goals
  User opens form
  Submits to Flask
  Flask writes to SQLite
  Template reloads and re-renders items
  Edit modal enables updates via prefilled fields

Journaling
  Add entries via form submission
  Edit entries via AJAX → /journal/edit/<id>
  Delete using standard POST form

Study Sessions
  User starts a timer (JS)
  Banner appears
  Ending session opens the reflection modal
  JS POSTs seconds + notes to /save_session
  Totals displayed on monthly view

Daily Events Calendar
  This is the most interactive component.

Flow:
  days.html loads with ?date=YYYY-MM-DD

JS:
Parses date
Builds 24-hour grid
Fetches events from /events/<date>
User clicks hour → event modal opens
Add/edit/delete events via AJAX
UI updates without reload
This modular JavaScript design keeps the template simple and the interactions powerful.

Navigation & Page Flow

The navigation bar in layout.html ensures universal access to:

Dashboard

Tasks

Goals

Journal

Study Mode

Because all pages extend layout.html, updates to nav or global CSS apply everywhere automatically.

Design Rationale
  Why this structure works:
  Template inheritance reduces duplication
  Modular JavaScript eliminates cross-page conflicts
  Each feature is isolated but consistent
  SQLite is ideal for small apps with local persistence
  Flask keeps the backend lightweight and readable
  Modals provide clean, modern UX

The new templates make the project feel cohesive and production-ready.

Future Improvements
  Frontend
  Drag-and-drop event scheduling
  Dark mode
  Weekly/Monthly full calendar views
  Animations for modals and grid changes

  Backend
  User authentication
  API endpoints for mobile apps
  Export/Import feature (JSON or CSV)
  Database
  Add timestamps for creations/edits
  Allow recurring events

Deployment Notes
The app can run locally with: python app.py

For production:
Debug mode disabled
